tidy-dataset
============

The course project for Coursera's course on Getting and Cleaning Data. Everything needed to create a tidy dataset from wearable data.



Decisions
---------
The tidy dataset reflects decisions that were made to resolve ambiguity or to
provide clarity. The following list explains these decisions.

1. Creation of the CodeBook from scratch rather than starting from the original data set's code book.
  * The [Evaluation/Feedback section](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-004/human_grading/view/courses/972137/assessments/3/submissions) asks for a code book that *modifies and updates the codebooks available to you*.
  * A dissenting opinion appears in a [TA response](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-004/forum/thread?thread_id=271#post-1639): *You are creating a codebook from scratch and describe what transformations or renaming you did as part of text*
  * I chose to follow the TA post. My reasoning is that the original codebook is available for reference, and including information from it would complicate explanation of the tidy dataset. The original information is not necessarily pertinent, but is available onm the web if needed.
